## A universal converter that converts everything that can be run inside a docker container

A service that converts file to various formats... as long as they are defined. You can define the number of formats with classes and Docker definitions.

### Example implementations

    * ffmpeg
      * mkv -> mp3
      * mp4 -> mp3
    * tesseract
      * jpg -> pdf

### Features

    * every conversion process runs isolated in a separated docker container
    * source and target format conversion are defined in a class and can be therefore extended wigth custom converters, e.g.:
      * mp4 to mp3 will look for a class called `Mp4ToMp3` having a `ConverterInterface` (see converter/ConverterInterface.php)
    * no database required (is that a feature?)

### Requirements

    * PHP v8
    * Docker
    * optional: nodejs (for the terminal conversion client)

### Build

    $ composer install
    $ composer dump-autoload -o
    $ cd client && npm install

### Define your accesstoken(s)

By default, a simple accesstoken lookup is used.

Create a `config/config.local.yml` file which has the following data:

```yaml
users:
  by_accesstoken:
    933704aabab8314e7cd2385428591eda737fecec:
      email: apiuser
```

You can now use the accestoken in the header like: `Authorization: Bearer 933704aabab8314e7cd2385428591eda737fecec`

### Start services

Run server:

    $ composer run start
